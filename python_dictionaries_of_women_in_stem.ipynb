    "Learning objectives\n",
    "1. Learners become familiar with the concept of a Python dictionary and how it can be used to organize and retrieve information. \n",
    "2. Learners can name at least three famous women in STEM and one role that the woman had.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions that can be covered:\n",
    "- What is programming?\n",
    "- What is Python?\n",
    "- What is a dictionary?\n",
    "- What is a key?\n",
    "- What is a value?\n",
    "- Why is it written like this with funny characters and not just text? what's that called?\n",
    "- How do I make a dictionary myself or with a classmate? What is some information I want to organize?\n",
    "- What does 'STEM' stand for?\n",
    "- Who are some famous women in STEM?\n",
    "- What jobs do or did they have?\n",
    "- How can I learn more about Python? codeweek.eu -> Resources\n",
    "- How can I learn more about women in STEM? -> Go to your library and ask around in your community.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Print some of the dictionaries using the print() command. For example, print(ada_lovelace_dict) or just type in the name of the dictionary and then run it.\n",
    "2. Find out the value of a key in one of the dictionaries. For example, ada_lovelace_dict[\"second name\"] Practice getting the values of a bunch of different keys.\n",
    "3. Pick one of the women in STEM. Get a list of the keys in her dictionary. For example, ada_lovelace_dict.keys(). Try a couple of other women's names. How many names do they have? what are some of the different jobs they have or have had?\n",
    "4. What are the women in this dictionary famous for? Find out by pulling up the values associated to the key, \"famous for\". For example, ada_lovelace_dict[\"famous for\"]\n",
    "5. Who are three mathematicians from these dictionaries? three physicists? three chemists? For example, marie_sklowdowska_curie_dict[\"role\"]\n",
    "6. Check to see if one of the women was a mathematician by pulling up the role keys. Some women have up to three roles (\"role\", \"second role\", \"third role\").\n",
    "7. What kind of other roles besides STEM roles did some of these women have? Were they active in anything besides science, technology, engineering and mathematics?\n",
    "8. Add more women to your dictionary. For example, you can add the women who won Nobel Prizes in 2020: Andrea Mila Ghez (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_M._Ghez), Emmanuelle Charpentier (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuelle_Charpentier) and Jennifer Doudna (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Doudna) They are still living so for their date of birth just put, \"still living\" as the value. You can also pick someone from this timeline of women in science: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_women_in_science.\n",
    "9. Interview someone in your class and make a dictionary with their name, favorite color, favorite subject, and the name of a book that they recommend reading."

    "Follow-Up Activities\n",
    "1. Go to your local library and see if they have books on women in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Look for a nonfiction book, a biography. What did she study in school? Write a short report on the book and share it with your science, programming, math or language class. Draw a picture of her to go with your report. \n",
    "2. Add quotes by the women to these Python dictionaries, at the end of their dictionary. You have an example in some of the dictionaries, but not all. See if you can find quotes online or at your library.\n",
    "3. What is one of the roles that sounded interesting to you? Was there a role you had not heard of before? Was there a word that you had never heard before that sounded interesting? Go the library and find out more about one of the careers or subjects that sparks your curiosity. Write about it and share it with one of your classes at school.\n",
    "4. Who are some women in STEM in your town? Ask your local librarian. Find some women working as teachers, in medicine, in technology, or working in mathematics. Maybe they are working in finance or accounting. Do you know any? Ask them some questions, like what they like about their jobs or how they got started in their field.\n",
    "5. Use the Women in STEM dictionaries to make a quiz, working in pairs.\n",
    "6. What is one of the professional associations to which a famous woman in STEM belonged or belongs? Look at their Wikipedia pages to find one, and then find out more about it."
